Learning reflection:  The goal of this week activities was to be familiarise myself with basic Vue components that may be useful for my travel service website. Beside preparing myself for second draft submission using Vue, I also gain feedback from my tutor and classmates about my first draft submission. 

Next week, I expected:

•	After submitting my assignment 1, I will continue and implement more Vue concept on my proof of concept. Next week I aim to work on "form.vue".

• I will do some research about different types of form. I would like to implement step by step form using Vuejs.  

• I also do some refinement on my prototypes so I may need to change some concept on my proof-of-concept. 

Task 1: 

Before start working on the first task, I create a Vue file by installing #CDN on my project in HTML file. Declarative rendering allows us to render data to the DOM using simple template syntax in Vue. To interpolate the needed data in the DOM, double curly brackets are applied as placeholders. I also try the v-bind attribute in this first task to render out dynamical bound title.

Task 2:

The second component we learned this week is conditionals and loops. First of all, I play around with v-if and v-else to simply change the element’s visibility.

There are several additional directives, the v-for loop is essentially a for-each loop. I give it a list of objects and give each one a name, so that I can use to show it based on data from an Array.

V-show works similarly to the v-if directive in that it changes the display of the target element or View, but with one significant distinction. V-if removes the element entirely from the view, whereas v-show maintains the element on the screen but just changes the opacity to 0%, or transparent.

Task 3

The last activity is to discuss my design concept with tutor and classmates in a breakout room. I presented my website as long as my proposal to gain some feedback from classmates and tutor in order to improve my website design. My tutor suggested to improve my UI/UX design on Figma by create the mobile version, so that I can test the responsiveness when I implement it on my website. Additionally, I had only 7 user stories, so my classmate suggested to add more user stories to help me gain knowledge and understanding about the user needs.
